Mocking is when you emulate something. Or replace a real thing, with a simulated version

Mocking is used when testing a complex app.

Example: - You have an app with five different classes that are all related, talking to each other, or are nested. - All of the objects are tightly connected, which makes it difficult to test each piece individually - To test only one of the objects at a time, we can emulate (or mock) each object separately to make sure each piece works on its own (unit testing)
