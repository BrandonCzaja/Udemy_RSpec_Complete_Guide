# TDD: Test-Driven Development

-   The idea of TDD is to write your tests BEFORE you build your program.
    -   This forces you to think about HOW something should work, piece by piece, method by method

## How to Follow TDD

-   Red, Green, Refactor

### Red

-   Failing - But not in a bad way
-   You write a test that you expect to fail because the corresponding code doesn't exist yet

### Green

-   Passing
-   Write the bare-minimum code to make that test pass

### Refactor

-   Assuming all the tests are passing, you then refactor the code to clean it up, but in a way that doesn't break the tests

### Start out small, make it fail, make it succeed, make it optimal
